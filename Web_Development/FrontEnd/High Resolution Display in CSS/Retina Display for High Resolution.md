# High Resolution Display using the Retina Image Concept

Apple introduced a display called the "Retina Display" that has much better resolution than our normal display, such as a picture element per inch (PPI) or dots per inch (DPI). This display has high resolution power, and we can easily distinguish between normal and retina displays because each display varies in size and specifications.

## Display Resolution

The display resolution of the device, like a laptop monitor or smart TV, has a variety of different pixels in every space that may be displayed. In digital mensuration, the display resolution is measured in pixels per inch (PPI).

There are two types of display resolution we can define:-

1) Low Display Resolution: The display on which pixels per inch have a low value is called low display resolution. It is less sharp as compared to high resolution.
2) High Display Resolution: The display in which pixels per inch have a higher value as compared to others is called a "high display resolution" and it is more clear.

## Retina Display

A Retina display is a term created by Apple to describe devices and monitors that have a resolution and element density so high that someone is unable to recognise the individual pixels at a traditional viewing distance. Now, The Apple device's display was well received and greatly improved the viewing experience.

Difference between Non Retina Display and Retina Display

The retina display is used in many Apple products, like the Apple Watch, Apple iPhone, Apple iPad, etc. The Retina Display of Apple is not a fixed sharpness, it depends on the viewer's distance from the display. If the viewer is nearer to the screen, it means he/she will see the more pixelated display. If he/she is far from the screen, then he/she is not able to see much better resolution.Â 

The simplest way to make your pictures properly appear on high-resolution displays, like the MacBook execs' "Retina Display," is to set their breadth and height values to 1/2 of the file size. Here is an example of a picture that's half the height and width:

```css
<style>
  img { height: 250px; width: 250px; }
</style>
<img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture">
```
